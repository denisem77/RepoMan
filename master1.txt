This is my second attempt committing. Be sure to do what thou wilt with this info. Naw Im just kidding.

Anyways when you commit:

git commit -m "Be sure to place in quotations what is happening. Ex: This is my second Git Commit"
Then be sure to check the git status. 

So far you have learned:
git init: initializes the repo

git commit: Adds changes to the repo

git status: shows you the status of the data for the repo: anything is red is waiting to be added. if its green...its good just waiting to be committed.

mkdir: makes a new directory/folder

touch: creates a new file

notepad <name of .txt file>: will open file in notepad to allow text to be added.

clear: cleans GitBash slate

how to link remote repo to github repo:
Create remote repo
go to github and create new repo
be sure the names of the repos match between the local and github repo folder
go to folder in terminal 
git init
git remote add origin (put your github ssh url here without parenthasis)
VERIFY CONNECTION:
git remote -v

for the first push to initiate the upstream connect of local to github:
git push -u origin main



LETS MAKE A BRANCH:
git checkout -b (name your branch. no parenthesis needed)
%You automatically switch to the folder after creation.

ALREADY MADE A BRANCH?
git branch: This will list all the branches in the repo

git fetch origin: updates the local repo with the remote repo

SWITCH BRANCHES:
